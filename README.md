# Introduction

This repository is a jekyll site that contains my personal notes on some IT topics. It is hosted on github pages at https://aitorfi.github.io/knowledge-base/.

## Development

To edit the website you can simple clone the repository edit the markdown files, push the changes to GitHub and the deployment will be made automagically. You don't need to have jekyll installed unless you want to visualize the changes you make.

If you want to install jekyll you can do it by following [this tutorial](https://aitorfi.github.io/knowledge-base/software-development/jekyll/installation/).
