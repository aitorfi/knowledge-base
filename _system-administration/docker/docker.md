# Docker

Docker is a platform that allows developers to package, distribute, and run applications in a standardized way using containers. Containers are lightweight, portable units that encapsulate an application and all its dependencies (such as libraries, runtime, and configurations) in a single package. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, from development to production.
