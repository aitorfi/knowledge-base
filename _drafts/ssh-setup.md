# SSH Setup

@see [man sshd_config](https://linux.die.net/man/5/sshd_config)

## Installation

To install the client run the following command:

```bash
apt install openssh-client
```

To install the server run the following command:

```bash
apt install openssh-server
```

## Configuration

The ssh configuration files are `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` for the client configuration and `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for the server configuration.

### Server configuration

Here is a list of common configuration options for an ssh server:

- **PermitRootLogin:** Specifies whether or not it is possible to login as root via ssh, the possible values are `yes`, `no`, `without-password` and `forced-commands-only`. The default value is `yes`.
- **Port:** Specifies the port number that the ssh service will use to listen for connections.

Here is an example of an `/etc/ssh/sshd_conf` file with a custom configuration that doesn't allow logins as root and makes the ssh service listen on port 4242:

```
# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
